                  AddedNodeSelector is an additional selector that can be used to
                  complement a NodeSelector or NodeAffinity as set on the VM
                  to restrict the set of allowed target nodes for a migration.
                  In case of key collisions, values set on the VM objects
                  are going to be preserved to ensure that addedNodeSelector
                  can only restrict but not bypass constraints already set on the VM object.

                        description: |-
                          AllowPostCopy enables post-copy live migrations. Such migrations allow even the busiest VMIs
                          to successfully live-migrate. However, events like a network failure can cause a VMI crash.
                          If set to true, migrations will still start in pre-copy, but switch to post-copy when
                          CompletionTimeoutPerGiB triggers. Defaults to false

                          If the timeout is reached, the migration will be either paused, switched
                          to post-copy or cancelled depending on other settings. Defaults to 150

                          By default, the SELinux level of target virt-launcher pods is forced to the level of the source virt-launcher.
                          When set to true, MatchSELinuxLevelOnMigration lets the CRI auto-assign a random level to the target.
                          That will ensure the target virt-launcher doesn't share categories with another pod on the node.
                          However, migrations will fail when using RWX volumes that don't automatically deal with SELinux levels.

                          Hitting this timeout means a migration transferred 0 data for that many seconds. The migration is
                          then considered stuck and therefore cancelled. Defaults to 150
